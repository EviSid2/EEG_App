You did great! Your brainwaves stayed smooth most of the session, which is fantastic. The focus was good too; you maintained that for a lot longer than expected. Keep it up! Next time try to keep your eyes slightly open during meditation to allow more natural breathing and reduce eye strain.
You seem to be doing well on the calm/stability score, but your focus could use some improvement. Try practicing a shorter session or focusing on a single object for a few minutes each day to build that sustained attention muscle.
