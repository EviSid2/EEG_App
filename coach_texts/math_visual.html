Great job! Your brainwaves stayed smooth throughout the session, which is a strong indicator of calmness. Your focus was steady, but you might want to give yourself a pat on the back for keeping your mind so calm. As for next time, try focusing on one point in math problems rather than trying to solve them all at once. This way, you can stay more focused and engaged without getting overwhelmed. Next time, try incorporating some guided imagery or deep breathing exercises to further enhance your mental clarity. That should help keep things even smoother and more focused. Keep up the good work!
