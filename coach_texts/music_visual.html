You did great with your focus! Your brainwaves stayed smooth throughout the session, which is fantastic. It's clear you were deeply engaged in listening to the music without any distractions. Keep up the good work!
Your calmness levels need a bit more attention. Your beta dominant frequency band suggests a slightly alert state rather than a relaxed one. You might consider incorporating some breathing exercises or gentle stretches to help settle your mind further.

Next time, try focusing on each beat of the music and using deep breaths to bring your focus back to the task when it starts drifting. This will enhance both calmness and concentration even more!
