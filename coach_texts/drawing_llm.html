You did a fantastic job with your brainwaves during this session! Your calmness and stability scores of 89/100 are impressive. Your focus quality score of 6/100 suggests that while you were able to maintain some level of concentration, it was challenging to hold for long periods. This is quite common when drawing or doodling, as the mind tends to wander easily.
Your attention drift score of 2/100 indicates that your pattern of activity changed frequently, which can be a sign of mental fatigue if you're not taking breaks. Your body stillness score of 98/100 shows that your signal was very clean and free from movement noise, making it easier to focus on the task at hand.

Your dominant frequency band of delta suggests that your brainwave patterns were consistent and calm, which is great for tasks like drawing where a steady mind can help maintain focus.

Next time you draw or doodle, try these practical suggestions tailored to your personal context:

1. Mindfulness Breathing: Before starting, take 5 deep breaths focusing on the rise and fall of your chest. This simple technique helps calm the mind and stabilize brainwaves.
2. Task-Specific Focus Practice: Try using a timer or app that reminds you every few minutes to refocus back to the task at hand. This can help prevent wandering thoughts.
Remember, everyone's brain is unique, so it might take some time to find what works best for you. Keep practicing these techniques and gradually build on your focus skills over time. You've already shown great progress with your stable brainwaves, and I'm confident that with continued effort, you'll continue improving!

Keep drawing!
