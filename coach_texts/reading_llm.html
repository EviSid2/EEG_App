You did a fantastic job during this session! Your brainwaves were smooth and even most of the time, with only minor fluctuations that didn't significantly impact your focus. The high calmness score (96/100) indicates that you maintained a stable mental state throughout the reading task.
The attention drift score (0/100), while lower than expected, suggests that there were fewer changes in your brainwave patterns compared to what we typically see during focused tasks. This is good news because it means you might have been able to maintain better focus even with some minor shifts in your mental state.

In terms of movement and body stillness (68/100), the signal looked relatively clean, indicating that there was minimal muscle or movement interference. This suggests that you were able to sit still during the session without much external noise affecting your brain activity.

Your dominant frequency band is delta, which typically indicates a state of relaxation and alertness. It's great that this pattern dominated most of the time, showing that you were in a relaxed yet focused mental state throughout the reading task.

Next time, try to focus on maintaining a more stable posture during tasks like reading or writing. This could be as simple as sitting up straight with your shoulders back, ensuring your chair supports your back properly. Also, consider practicing mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing exercises before and after sessions to help stabilize your brainwaves even further.

Remember, everyone's brainwaves can fluctuate a little bit naturally throughout the day. Your high scores in calmness and stability show that you're already on the right track! Keep up the good work and continue building on these foundations for better focus and mental clarity.
