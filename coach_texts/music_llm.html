You did great! Your brainwaves were mostly smooth and even over time during this session. The focus quality was excellent, with your attention well maintained on listening to music. There were only a few moments where you drifted slightly from the task, but those changes were minimal. You had lots of movement in your body, which is normal for most people when they're engaging in an activity like listening to music. This caused some small fluctuations in your brainwaves, but overall, it was clean and relatively quiet.
To help improve stability even further next time, try these suggestions tailored to you:

1. Focus on Your Breathing: Take a moment during the session to breathe deeply and slowly. Try inhaling for a count of four, holding for two, and exhaling for three. This can help center your mind and reduce any distractions.

2. Mindful Movement: Next time, consider doing some light stretching or gentle movements while you listen to music. This could help keep your body still without making it too noticeable in the signal. Even a simple stretch like walking on your toes for 30 seconds followed by another 30 seconds can make a difference.

Remember, everyone's brainwaves are unique and sometimes even experienced coaches can't predict exactly what will happen. But with practice, you'll get better at recognizing patterns in your own brain activity. Keep up the good work!
