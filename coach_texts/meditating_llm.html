You had a great session! Your brainwaves were mostly smooth and even over time, with your calm / stability score at 100/100. This shows that your focus came and went but was generally steady throughout the session. The attention drift score of 2/100 suggests you experienced fewer changes in your mental state compared to other times, which is great! Your body stillness score of 61/100 indicates less muscle and movement noise in the signal, making your brainwaves clearer and cleaner.
However, there were a few areas where you could focus better. The attention drift was higher than usual, which means your mental state wasn't as stable or focused as it usually is. This might be due to some distractions during the session or changes in how you typically meditate.

Here are two practical suggestions tailored to your personal context:

Meditation Technique Adjustment: Try incorporating a simple breathing exercise into your meditation routine, such as the 4-7-8 technique. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds. This can help stabilize your mind and improve focus.

Posture and Positioning: Ensure you're sitting up straight with minimal distractions around you. Try to minimize any physical movements that might interfere with your brainwave signal. Keep your eyes focused on a steady point in front of you, like the wall or a small object, which can help maintain mental clarity.

Remember, everyone's brainwaves are unique and change over time based on various factors. Your session was great, and by tweaking these areas, you'll likely see improvements in focus and stability. Keep practicing, and your mindfulness skills will continue to grow!
