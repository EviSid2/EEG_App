You seem quite stable in your mind's state during the game. Your brainwaves were smooth and even throughout most of the session, indicating you maintained a calm. Your focus was a bit low, so your brain looked a little restless at times. While there was some movement stillness, it wasn't noticeable, which is great! Keep this steady approach to ensure clarity and precision.
Next time, try incorporating short moments of mindfulness meditation into your routine before starting the game or any other task that requires concentration. This will help keep your mind focused without adding unnecessary stress. Keep practicing, you'll get there!
