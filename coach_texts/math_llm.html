You did great! Your brainwaves were mostly smooth and even over time, with a calmness score of 100/100. While there was some attention drift at times (25/100), which can happen when you're engaged in complex tasks like solving math problems, it doesn't seem to have significantly impacted the overall quality of your brainwaves.
Your body stillness score of 96/100 is excellent! This suggests that there was little movement interference in your signal, making it easier for your EEG to accurately capture and analyze your brain activity. Your dominant frequency band also indicated a relaxed state (delta), which matches well with the task you were working on.

Looking ahead, I have two suggestions tailored specifically for you:

Mindfulness Practice: Try incorporating short mindfulness exercises into your daily routine. Even 5 minutes of focusing on your breath or body sensations can help maintain focus and reduce mind wandering. This practice can be especially helpful if you find your mind easily drifting away during tasks like math problems.

Consistent Breathing Habits: Since your attention drift score was moderate (17/100), it might be beneficial to establish a consistent breathing pattern. A simple technique is the "4-7-8" method: inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and exhale slowly for 8 seconds. This can help stabilize your brainwaves and improve concentration.

Stay confident in your abilities! With practice, this will become easier and more natural. Keep up the good work, and soon you’ll achieve even greater stability and focus on tasks like solving math problems. Remember, everyone's brain works differently, so it's great that you're open to feedback and suggestions tailored to your specific situation. Keep up the good work!
