You seemed really centered throughout the session. Your brainwaves stayed smooth most of the time, which is fantastic! It looks like you have a strong focus score too, so that's great. Just slightly restless in your movements, but overall very calm. To keep this level of stability and focus next time, try to stay present with each breath as you meditate. This will help maintain that smooth, steady brainwave pattern. Keep it up!
