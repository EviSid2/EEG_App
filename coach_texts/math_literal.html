Your brainwaves stayed smooth for most of the session, which is great! Your mind looked very calm. Your calmness is excellent, but your focus could use a bit of boost next time to make sure everything stays on track.
You're doing really well, but you could aim to keep your focus steady even more. Try a few deep breaths before starting each task and maybe pay attention to where your thoughts wander. This can help keep your brain in the right place for better performance! Keep it up!
